# Curve-Fitting-Interpolation-Method
Curve fitting is the process of modeling or representing a data spread by assigning a mathematical function (curve) along the entire range. Interpolation is used when we need to discover a function that is an exact  fit to the data points provided that all data points extracted are accurate without any errors.
